# Lab 4: Interrupts, timers

## Preparation tasks (done before the lab at home)

Consider an n-bit number that we increment based on the clock signal. If we reach its maximum value and try to increase it, the value will be reset. We call this state an overflow. The overflow time depends on the frequency of the clock signal, the number of bits, and on the prescaler value:

Calculate the overflow times for three Timer/Counter modules that contain ATmega328P if CPU clock frequency is 16&nbsp;MHz. Complete the following table for given prescaler values. Note that, Timer/Counter2 is able to set 7 prescaler values, including 32 and 128.

| **Module** | **Number of bits** | **1** | **8** | **32** | **64** | **128** | **256** | **1024** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Timer/Counter0 | 8  | 16u | 128u | -- | 1,024m | -- | 2,048m | 16,384m |
| Timer/Counter1 | 16 | 4,096m | 32,768m | -- | 0,262 | -- | 1,049 | 4,194 |
| Timer/Counter2 | 8  | 16u | 128u | 512u | 1,024m | 2,048m | 4,096m | 16,384m |

Shields are boards that can be attached to an Arduino board, significantly expand its capabilities, and makes prototyping much faster. See schematic of [Multi-function shield](../../Docs/arduino_shield.pdf) and find out the connection of four LEDs (D1, D2, D3, D4) and three push buttons (S1-A1, S2-A2, S3-A3).

The timer modules can be configured with several special purpose registers. According to the [ATmega328P datasheet](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega328p) (eg in the **8-bit Timer/Counter0 with PWM > Register Description** section), which I/O registers and which bits configure the timer operations?
